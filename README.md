# Description
This project serves as a proxy for requests to the Czech National Bank (CNB) API. It enables fetching data from CNB endpoints within a frontend application while bypassing Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) restrictions.

The application is built with Node.js and is deployed as a serverless application on AWS.
